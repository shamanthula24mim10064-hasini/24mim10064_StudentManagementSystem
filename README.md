Student Management System (Console-Based Java Application)
1. Overview
The Student Management System is a console-based Java application designed to maintain and manage basic student information. The system supports fundamental CRUD operations, including adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting student records. It follows a modular, object-oriented structure suitable for academic and practical learning purposes.

2. Features
